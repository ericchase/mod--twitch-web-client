## About

https://github.com/ericchase/mod--discord-web-client

This project is the successor to my attempt at creating a semi-automated modder for the Discord desktop client (https://github.com/ericchase/mod--discord-client). The desktop client has a TON of issues before even getting to styling. After months of working against their constant updates, I decided to uninstall and start using the browser client.

## Usage

Simply install the userscripts and stylesheets that can be found in the folders outlined below:

### ./out

In this folder, there is a userscript that applies fixes which cannot be done through CSS alone. Userscripts are used with extensions like Greasemonkey, Violentmonkey, Tampermonkey, etc that can inject JavaScript into websites.

### ./src-styles

This folder contains the actual user stylesheets that apply most of the fixes to the Discord client. These can be used with extensions like Stylus that can inject CSS into websites.
